# Deep Learning: Technology and Applications(Spring 2021)
Deep Learning is regarded as a panacea in the era of big data.
In this course, you will learn the foundations of deep learning, understand how to interprete others' neural networks, and learn how to build your own neural networks.
You will also learn about popular neural network structures including Convolutional neural networks, RNNs, LSTM, and transformers.
